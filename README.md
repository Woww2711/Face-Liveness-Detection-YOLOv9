## Overview
This project aims to create a decent Face Liveness Detection model from [YOLOv9](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov9/)
- The goal is to find and detect 3 kinds of face in input images or videos, and the predicted output will contain label and bounding boxes in every frame
- The 3 kinds of face are:
  + Replay: Images of faces from various people from many videos (0)
  + Real: Images of real faces (1)
  + Mask: Images of people wearing human-like mask (2)
- Data collected from [kaggle](kaggle.com), most come from [Training Data](https://www.kaggle.com/trainingdatapro) and [zalo](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hlly34/liveness-detection-zalo-2022)
