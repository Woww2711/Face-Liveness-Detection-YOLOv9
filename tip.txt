1. Train online

2. Upload data.zip file to drive

3. Ask friends and family for video if needed

4. If training session stopped but hasn't reach last epoch, do model=last.pt and add resume=True to continue where you left of

5. If you're training on Colab free, press F12, go to console, paste
        function ClickConnect() {
        console.log("Working"); 
        document
        .querySelector('#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button')
        .shadowRoot.querySelector('#connect')
        .click() 
        }
        setInterval(ClickConnect, 60000)  
    This will stop Colab from killing the session even if you AFK.

6. Don't auto save on colab folder, save your model frequently on Drive by adding project="Your path to save model" to the .train() method, check the ultralytics website for more info

7. More data = more generalized model.
